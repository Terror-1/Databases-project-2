1First we need to update the statistics using the ANALYZE , VACUM command 
1) vacuum commad : delete the dead tuples that have been created previously (helpful in case of updated data)
 -----warning :::: dont use vacuum and vacuum full before checking if there is any dead tuples you can check that by running 
         --- > SELECT relname, n_dead_tup FROM pg_stat_user_tables; //know number of dead tuples 
         ----> SELECT nspname || '.' || relname AS "relation",
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(C.oid)) AS "size"
  FROM pg_class C
  LEFT JOIN pg_namespace N ON (N.oid = C.relnamespace)
  WHERE nspname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema')
  ORDER BY pg_relation_size(C.oid) DESC
  LIMIT 20;      ///know the disk size
         ----> SELECT relname ,last_vacuum , last_auto_vacuum From pg_stat_user_table ; // know what is the time of last vacuum
---- vacuum verbose analyze 'table name' ;


2) Explain 
   -- ANALYZE
   -- VERBOSE 
   -- FORMAT (JSON , TEXT)
